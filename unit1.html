<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

<p>IT's role in modern business is wide and varied, with many businesses unable to function in its absence. The internet allows organisations to be in touch with their audience, this sort of communication is vital for marketing and helps companies build their brand and reputation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>IT has innumerable practical applications in modern business, such as managing data, making calculations and facilitating connectivity between team members. The benefits of this connectivity allow for better time management and overall productivity.</p>

<h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>

<p>A range of skills are required in order to successfully complete digital projects. Good organisational skills, communication and time management can be complimented by applying methods such as Kanban; this will allow members of your team to visualise all tasks at hand and provide at-a-glance progress updates. This can be facilitated through the use of online productivity tools such as Trello which allows users to effectively multi-task. Sharing information and data via online platforms such as GitHub, Slack and other cloud-based storage will streamline a team's efforts, saving time and increasing productivity.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?  Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>

<p>Planning projects effectively requires the ability to multi-task. Methodologies such as Kanban can be applied to a team's workload in order to better organise workflow. The Kanban method of 'TO DO, DOING and DONE' is a type of scheduling system that boosts productivity and fits into the Agile working methodology.</p>
<p></p>
<p> "Agile working is a way of working in which an organisation empowers its people to work where, when and how they choose – with maximum flexibility and minimum constraints – to optimise their performance and to do their best work"</p>

<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>

<p>Risks that can impact digital projects and cause their failure include: poor planning, inadequate management, lack of leadership, poor communication, lack of user testing/failure to implement user feedback, poorly defined outcomes/failure to solve the problem presented.</p> 
    
    <p></p>

<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/09/13/are-these-the-real-reasons-why-tech-projects-fail/#2723353b7320">[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/09/13/are-these-the-real-reasons-why-tech-projects-fail/#2723353b7320]</a>
<p></p>

<p>Without addressing these risks, a digital project's likelihood to fail is increased. The project could suffer from poor time management and run over-budget without delivering the intended outcome.</p>

<a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care"> [https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care]</a>
<p></p>

<p>It is therefore vitally important that all digital projects should be effectively managed, providing accountabilty and structure for those working towards its completion.</p>

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>

<p>It is important to ensure that IT systems and software selected to complete projects is fit for purpose. Researching different IT solutions for individual projects allows an organisation to select the best fit for the problem that needs to be solved. Some limitations may be caused by lack of budget, with certain platforms restricting features in free versions of their product. For example, free use of Slack only allows a team's last 10,000 messages to be accessed. Depending on the size of your team and timeline of the project, this allowance may not be adequate.</p>

<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>

<p>Using Trello and the Kanban method has improved my ability to multi-task, making working on several different tasks at once easier. The visual interface of the card system allows at-a-glance progress updates, making dipping in and out of different tasks more manageable and presenting each individual task in bite-sized chunks. This impacts the overall productivity and easily communicates where a project is up to.</p>

   <p> GitHub is a platform that allows developers to share code they've been working on, it streamlines a team's efforts, ensure work is not duplicated and provides version control. These factors improve overall productivity. Version control is a useful tool when working as part of a wider team, in the event changes/errors occur within the code, problems can be easily rectified by reverting to an earlier version.</p>

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2> 

<p>GDPR is a progressive approach to how people's personal data should be handled,<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018"> [https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018]</a> . It provides a legal framework and guidelines for the collecting and processing of personal information belonging to those living within the European Union (EU).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Failure to comply with the legislation set out in GDPR can result in businesses receiving hefty fines, which impacts an organisation's financial stability and their reputation. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/fines-penalties/"> [https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/fines-penalties/]</a></p>
