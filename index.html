    <p>I have a background in the arts, having worked in art galleries around the North West throughout my career. In 2015 I got involved at Leigh Hackspace and after building a community darkroom for the space I was invited to join the Board of Directors in 2016.</p>

        <p>I’m a STEM ambassador and help people of all ages be creative through Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. I have primarily worked in analogue photographic techniques but would love to expand my practice into digital arts.</p>
        
        <p>I’m really excited about the new creative potential that's available through the coding skills I’ve gained at CodeNation.</p>
