            <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,Trello</h2>

            <p>I am happy with the IT tools I used for the website project. I find Trello really useful even when working alone, it's a tool that I already have experience of using before starting the CodeNation course. I find the kanban method I've use with Trello a helpful way to track and review my own progress with projects as well as allowing me to easily prioritise multiple tasks. Trello is a fantastic organisational tool and I would be lost without it.</p>

            <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>

            <p>My design is a very simple layout. There are 3 pages: a home page containing "about me" information and links to outcomes for Unit 1 and Unit 2. All pages contain these links at the top centre of the page, making it possible to navigate between all pages, from any page on the site. I have used a bright colour to make these links more eye-catching and obvious in the interest of user experience.</p>



        <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

        <p>Copyright is a type of Intellectual Property Right that is usually automatically granted to the creator or author of content (photography, music, texts etc.) that appears on the websites we build. Copyright can be owned by an individual or by a business.</p>

        <p></p>

            <p>"Copyright protects your work and stops others from using it without your permission. You get copyright protection automatically - you don’t have to apply or pay a fee. There isn’t a register of copyright works in the UK." <a href=https://www.gov.uk/copyright>https://www.gov.uk/copyright</a></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You automatically get copyright protection when you create:</p>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including illustration and photography
                    <li>original non-literary written work, such as software, web content and databases
                        <li>sound and music recordings
                            <li> film and television recordings
                                <li>broadcasts
                                    <li> the layout of published editions of written, dramatic and musical works

            <p>It is important to ensure that such content is legally permitted to be reproduced on a website and the correct consent and permission to use copyrighted material has been allowed by the owner. Penalties for breach of these laws include fines and prison time.</p>

            <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>Attention to design, colour and the structure/layout of information is important when considering the accessibility needs of those with visual impairment. Good design for such websites will also include link that have descriptive, unique names that will be easily identifiable to those who are using accessibility tools such as screen reader software. Links such as 'click here' alone would not be considered user-friendly for the visually impaired as they are too vague and not necessarily obviously related to content the user is trying to find.</p>
<p></p>
                <p>Additionally heading should be clearly defined from the body of text and pictures should include an informative description. <a href=https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility>[https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility]</a></p>
                <p></p>
<h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>

<p>Appropriate file types for use on websites vary depending on the type of content you're sharing. Choosing the wrong file type for your content can result in a loss of quality or the file being unnecessarily large. For example, JPG files are recommended for photographic content, but not images containing text. GIF and/or PNG would be better choices to display an image that includes text, such as a diagram or flowchart. <a href=https://www2.le.ac.uk/webcentre/plone/build/basics/add-images/image-file-types>[https://www2.le.ac.uk/webcentre/plone/build/basics/add-images/image-file-types]</a></p>


<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>

<p>Using Visual Studio Code has been a good experience. I like how user-friendly it is. The ability to hover the cursor over different parts of the syntax and have an explanation of its use and purpose is a great feature of Visual Studio Code for beginners like myself. I'd be happy to use this software again for future projects, especially whilst still getting to grips with coding.</p>

<h2> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>

<p>I am happy with what I have managed to produce in the short time allowed for this project and believe it to be a decent first attempt.</p>
<p></p>
   <p> I have tried to consider navigation, usability and the overall aesthetics of my project. I think though these elements all work, given more time, greater experience and additional technical ability the project could benefit from a better layout: I'd hoped to include more photography in a grid layout on my home page, to the right of the text. With more time and practise I could have utilised flexbox to achieve this.</p>

   <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

   <p>Given a longer deadline I would have liked to have been able to add a photography portfolio in a grid layout.</p>
   <p></p>
   <p> More user testing and subsequent feedback could also help improve the final outcome.</p>
   <p></p>
    The pages for the coursework units could have better navigation; a type of contents/indexing at the beginning of the unit page using anchor tags to link to (or jump to) specific outcomes further down the page could make these sections to be easier to navigate if looking for specific information.</p>

    <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

    <p>I've used a CSS class to define the appearance of specific elements (e.g. div class="navbar") and allow page links to appear as navigational buttons in the top centre. This class used in conjunction with HTML anchor tags link to the relevant unit files/pages. e.g. a href="unit1.html" class = "button">Unit 1</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This enables the user to easily navigate between any of the pages without using the browser's back button and select the page they wish to look at rather than the page that immediately preceded it. Subsequently, I feel this makes the website fit for purpose without any errors displayed.</p>
