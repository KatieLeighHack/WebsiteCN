        <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

        <p>Copyright is a type of Intellectual Property Right that is usually automatically granted to the creator or author of content (photography, music, texts etc.) that appears on the websites we build. Copyright can be owned by an individual or by a business.</p>

        <p></p>

            <p>"Copyright protects your work and stops others from using it without your permission. You get copyright protection automatically - you don’t have to apply or pay a fee. There isn’t a register of copyright works in the UK." <a href=https://www.gov.uk/copyright>https://www.gov.uk/copyright</a></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You automatically get copyright protection when you create:</p>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including illustration and photography
                    <li>original non-literary written work, such as software, web content and databases
                        <li>sound and music recordings
                            <li> film and television recordings
                                <li>broadcasts
                                    <li> the layout of published editions of written, dramatic and musical works
                                    </ul>
                                        <a href=https://www.gov.uk/copyright>[https://www.gov.uk/copyright]</a></p>
                                        <p></p>
            
            <p>It is important to ensure that such content is legally permitted to be reproduced on a website and the correct consent and permission to use copyrighted material has been allowed by the owner. Penalties for breach of these laws include fines and prison time.</p>
            
            <p>It is important to note that an individual working for a company, for example providing software development, would not usually own the intellectual property rights to any software written whilst carrying out their job. These rights remain with the company.</p>

            <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>Attention to design, colour and the structure/layout of information is important when considering the accessibility needs of those with visual impairment. Good design for such websites will also include link that have descriptive, unique names that will be easily identifiable to those who are using accessibility tools such as screen reader software. Links such as 'click here' alone would not be considered user-friendly for the visually impaired as they are too vague and not necessarily obviously related to content the user is trying to find.</p>
<p></p>
                <p>Additionally heading should be clearly defined from the body of text and pictures should include an informative description. <a href=https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility>[https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility]</a></p>
                <p></p>
<h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>

<p>Appropriate file types for use on websites vary depending on the type of content you're sharing. Choosing the wrong file type for your content can result in a loss of quality or the file being unnecessarily large. For example, JPG files are recommended for photographic content, but not images containing text. GIF and/or PNG would be better choices to display an image that includes text, such as a diagram or flowchart. <a href=https://www2.le.ac.uk/webcentre/plone/build/basics/add-images/image-file-types>[https://www2.le.ac.uk/webcentre/plone/build/basics/add-images/image-file-types]</a></p>
